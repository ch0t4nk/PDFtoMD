# SN65HVD230, SN65HVD231, SN65HVD232

> These devices have limited built-in ESD protection. The leads should be shorted together or the device placed in conductive foam during storage or handling to prevent electrostatic damage to the MOS gates.

## DESCRIPTION

The SN65HVD230, SN65HVD231, and SN65HVD232 controller area network (CAN) transceivers are designed for use with the Texas Instruments TMS320LX240™; 3.3-V DSPs with CAN controllers, or with equivalent devices. They are intended for use in applications employing the CAN serial communication physical layer in accordance with the ISO 11898 standard. Each CAN transceiver is designed to provide differential transmit capability to the bus and differential receive capability to a CAN controller at speeds up to 1 Mbps.

Designed for operation in especially-harsh environments, these devices feature cross-wire protection, loss-of-ground and overvoltage protection, overtemperature protection, as well as wide common-mode range.

The transceiver interfaces the single-ended CAN controller with the differential CAN bus found in industrial, building automation, and automotive applications. It operates over a -2 V to 7 V common-mode range on the bus, and it can withstand common-mode transients of ±25 V.

On the SN65HVD230 and SN65HVD231, pin 8 provides three different modes of operation: high-speed, slope control, and low-power modes. The high-speed mode of operation is selected by connecting pin 8 to ground, allowing the transmitter output transistors to switch on and off as fast as possible with no limitation on the rise and fall slopes. The rise and fall slopes can be adjusted by connecting a resistor to ground at pin 8, since the slope is proportional to the pin's output current. This slope control is implemented with external resistor values of 10 kΩ, to achieve a 15 V/µs slew rate, to 100 kΩ, to achieve a 2 V/µs slew rate. See the Application Information section of this datasheet.

The circuit of the SN65HVD230 enters a low-current standby mode during which the driver is switched off and the receiver remains active if a high logic level is applied to pin 8. The DSP controller reserves this low-current standby mode when a dominant state (differential voltage > 900 mV typical) occurs on the bus.

The unique difference between the SN65HVD230 and the SN65HVD231 is that both the driver and the receiver are switched off in the SN65HVD231 when a high logic level is applied to pin 8 and remains in this sleep mode until the circuit is reactivated by a low logic level on pin 8.

The Vref pin 5 on the SN65HVD230 and SN65HVD231 is available as a VCC/2 voltage reference.

The SN65HVD232 is a basic CAN transceiver with no added options; pins 5 and 8 are NC, no connection.

It presents a typical application circuit and test results, as well as discussions on slope control, total loop delay, and interoperability in 5-V systems.

## INTRODUCTION

ISO 11898 is the international standard for high-speed serial communication using the controller area network (CAN) bus protocol. It supports multmaster operation, real-time control, programmable data rates up to 1 Mbps, and powerful redundant error checking procedures that provide reliable data transmission. It is suited for networking intelligent devices as well as sensors and actuators within the rugged electrical environment of a machine chassis or factory floor. The SN65HVD230 family of 3.3-V CAN transceivers implement the lowest layers of the ISO/OSI reference model. This is the interface with the physical signaling output of the CAN controller of the Texas Instruments TMS320Lx240x 3.3-V DSPs, as illustrated in Figure 27.

### Implementation

- **TMS320Lx2403/6/7 3.3-V DSP**
- **Embedded CAN Controller**
- **SN65HVD230**
- **CAN Bus-Line**

The SN65HVD230 family of CAN transceivers are compatible with the ISO 11898 standard; this ensures interoperability with other standard-compliant products.

## APPLICATION OF THE SN65HVD230

Figure 28 illustrates a typical application of the SN65HVD230 family. The output of a DSP's CAN controller is connected to the serial driver input, pin D, and receiver serial output, pin R, of the transceiver. The transceiver is then attached to the differential bus lines at pins CANH and CANL. Typically, the bus is a twisted pair of wires with a characteristic impedance of 120 Ω, in the standard half-duplex multipoint topology of Figure 29. Each end of the bus is terminated with 120-Ω resistors in compliance with the standard to minimize signal reflections on the bus.

## FEATURES OF THE SN65HVD230, SN65HVD231, and SN65HVD232

The SN65HVD230/231/232 3.3-V CAN transceivers provide the interface between the 3.3-V TMS320Lx2403/6/7 CAN DSPs and the differential bus line, and are designed to transmit data at signaling rates up to 1 Mbps as defined by the ISO 11898 standard.

These transceivers feature 3.3-V operation and standard compatibility with signaling rates up to 1 Mbps, and also offer:
- 16-kV HBM ESD protection on the bus pins
- Thermal shutdown protection
- Bus fault protection
- Open-circuit receiver fail-safe

The fail-safe design of the receiver assures a logic high at the receiver output if the bus wires become open-circuited. If a high ambient operating environment temperature or excessive output current result in thermal shutdown, the bus pins become high impedance, while the D and R pins default to a logic high.

The bus pins are also maintained in a high-impedance state during low V_CC conditions to ensure glitch-free power-up and power-down bus protection for hot-plugging applications. This high-impedance condition also means that an unpowered node does not disturb the bus. Transceivers without this feature usually have a very low output impedance. This results in a high current demand when the transceiver is unpowered, a condition that could affect the entire bus.

## OPERATING MODES

RS (Pin 8) of the SN65HVD230 and SN65HVD231 provides for three different modes of operation: high-speed mode, slope-control mode, and low-power mode.

### High-Speed

The high-speed mode can be selected by applying a logic low to RS (pin 8). The high-speed mode of operation is commonly employed in industrial applications. High-speed allows the output to switch as fast as possible with no internal limitation on the output rise and fall slopes. The only limitations of the high-speed operation are cable length and radiated emission concerns, each of which is addressed by the slope control mode of operation.

If the low-power standby mode is to be employed in the circuit, direct connection to a DSP output pin can be used to switch between a logic-low level (< 1 V) for high-speed operation, and the logic-high level (> 0.75 VCC) for standby. 

**Figure 30** shows a typical DSP connection, and **Figure 31** shows the HVD230 driver output signal in high-speed mode on the CAN bus.

```
D   |  1  |  8  | RS
GND |  2  |  7  | CANH
VCC |  3  |  6  | CANL
R   |  4  |  5  | Vref
```

### Slope Control

Electromagnetic compatibility is essential in many applications using unshielded bus cable to reduce system cost. To reduce the electromagnetic interference generated by fast rise times and resulting harmonics, the rise and fall slopes of the SN65HVD230 and SN65HVD231 driver outputs can be adjusted by connecting a resistor.

## Slope Control/Standby Connection to a DSP

The slope of the driver output signal is proportional to the pin's output current. This slope control is implemented with an external resistor value of 10 kΩ to achieve a ±15 V/µs slew rate, and up to 100 kΩ to achieve a ±2.0 V/µs slew rate.

### Typical Driver Output Waveforms

Typical driver output waveforms from a pulse input signal with and without slope control are displayed below. A pulse input is used rather than NRZ data to clearly display the actual slew rate.

### Standby Mode (Listen Only Mode) of the HVD230

If a logic high (≥ 0.75 Vcc) is applied to R_s (pin 8) in Figure 30 and Figure 32, the circuit of the SN65HVD230 enters a low-current, listen only standby mode, during which the driver is switched off and the receiver remains active. In its listen only state, the transceiver is completely passive to the bus. It makes no difference if a slope control resistor is in place as shown in Figure 32. The DSP can reverse this low-power standby mode by applying a rising edge of a dominant state (bus differential voltage > 900 mV typical) occurs on the bus. The DSP, sensing bus activity, reactivates the driver circuit by placing a logic low (< 1.2 V) on R_s (pin 8).

### The Babbling Idiot Protection of the HVD230

Occasionally, a runaway CAN controller unintentionally sends messages that completely tie up the bus (what is referred to in CAN jargon as a babbling idiot). When this occurs, the DSP can engage the listen-only standby mode to disengage the driver and release the bus, even when access to the CAN controller has been lost. When the driver circuit is deactivated, its outputs default to a high-impedance state.

### Sleep Mode of the HVD231

The unique difference between the SN65HVD230 and the SN65HVD231 is that both driver and receiver are switched off in the SN65HVD231 when a logic high is applied to R_s (pin 8). The device remains in a very low power-sleep mode until the circuit is reactivated with a logic low applied to R_s (pin 8). While in this sleep mode, the bus pins are in a high-impedance state, while the D and R pins default to a logic high.

### LOOP PROPAGATION DELAY

Transceiver loop delay is a measure of the overall device propagation delay, consisting of the delay from the driver input to the differential outputs, plus the delay from the receiver inputs to its output.

The loop delay of the transceiver displayed in Figure 35 increases accordingly when slope control is being used. This increased loop delay means that the total bus length must be reduced to meet the CAN bit-timing requirements of the overall system. The loop delay becomes ± 100 ns when employing slope control with a 10-kΩ resistor, and ≈ 500 ns with a 100-kΩ resistor. Therefore, considering that the rule-of-thumb propagation

## Delay Characteristics

The delay of a typical bus cable is 5 ns/m. Slope control with the 100-kΩ resistor decreases the allowable bus length by the difference between the 500-ns max loop delay and the loop delay with no slope control, 70.7 ns. This equates to (500 - 70.7 ns) / 5 ns, or approximately 86 m less bus length. This slew-rate/bus length trade-off to reduce electromagnetic interference to adjoining circuits from the bus can also be solved with a quality shielded bus cable.

## ISO 11898 Compliance of SN65HVD230 Family of 3.3-V CAN Transceivers

### Introduction

Many users value the low power consumption of operating their CAN transceivers from a 3.3 V supply. However, some are concerned about the interoperability with 5-V supplied transceivers on the same bus. This report analyzes this situation to address those concerns.

### Differential Signal

CAN is a differential bus where complementary signals are sent over two wires, and the voltage difference between the two wires defines the logical state of the bus. The differential CAN receiver monitors this voltage difference and outputs the bus state with a single-ended output signal.

## SLOS346K – MARCH 2001 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2011

### Typical SN65HVD230 Differential Output Voltage Waveform

The CAN driver creates the difference voltage between CANH and CANL in the dominant state. The dominant differential output of the SN65HVD230 is greater than 1.5 V and less than 3 V across a 60-ohm load. The minimum required by ISO 11898 is 1.5 V and maximum is 3 V. These are the same limiting values for 5 V supplied CAN transceivers. The bus termination resistors drive the recessive bus state and not the CAN driver.

A CAN receiver is required to output a recessive state with less than 500 mV and a dominant state with more than 900 mV difference voltage on its bus inputs. The CAN receiver must do this with common-mode input voltages from -2 V to 7 volts. The SN65HVD230 family receivers meet these same input specifications as 5-V supplied receivers.

### Common-Mode Signal

A common-mode signal is an average voltage of the two signal wires that the differential receiver rejects. The common-mode signal comes from the CAN driver, ground noise, and coupled bus noise. Obviously, the supply voltage of the CAN transceiver has nothing to do with noise. The SN65HVD230 family driver lowers the common-mode output in a dominant bit by a couple hundred millivolts from that of most 5-V drivers. While this does not fully comply with ISO 11898, this small variation in the driver common-mode output is rejected by differential receivers and does not affect data, signal noise margins or error rates.

### Interoperability of 3.3-V CAN in 5-V CAN Systems

The 3.3-V supplied SN65HVD230 family of CAN transceivers are electrically interchangeable with 5-V CAN transceivers. The differential output is the same. The recessive common-mode output is the same. The dominant common-mode output voltage is a couple hundred millivolts lower than 5-V supplied drivers, while the receivers exhibit identical specifications as 5-V devices.

Electrical interoperability does not assure interchangeability, however. Most implementers of CAN buses recognize that ISO 11898 does not sufficiently specify the electrical layer and that standard compliance alone does not ensure interchangeability. This comes only with thorough equipment testing.

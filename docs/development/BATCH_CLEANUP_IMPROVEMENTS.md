# Batch File Management Improvements

## Problem Resolved
- **Batch JSONL files** were being created in the project root directory instead of the temp directory
- **No cleanup on errors** meant failed batch submissions left orphaned files
- **Cluttered workspace** with `batch_requests_*.jsonl` files

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Proper File Location
- ✅ Batch JSONL files now created in `temp/temp_batch/` directory
- ✅ Follows existing temp directory structure from config
- ✅ No more files cluttering the project root

### 2. Comprehensive Error Cleanup
- ✅ **Force cleanup on all errors** - JSONL files removed even if submission fails
- ✅ **Added explicit cleanup calls** in all error paths
- ✅ **Safety checks** to prevent accidental deletion of important files

### 3. Enhanced CLI Commands
- ✅ Added `cleanup` command to `batch_api.py`:
  ```bash
  python -m src.batch.batch_api cleanup
  ```
- ✅ **Smart cleanup** that removes orphaned files but preserves active sessions
- ✅ **Safety checks** for file age (only removes files older than 1 hour)

### 4. Integration with Existing Systems
- ✅ **Leveraged existing cleanup infrastructure** instead of duplicating code
- ✅ **Integrated with AUTO_CLEANUP config** setting in auto_batch workflow
- ✅ **Used existing cleanup patterns** from other scripts

## Available Cleanup Commands

### Batch-Specific Cleanup
```bash
# Clean up orphaned batch files
python -m src.batch.batch_api cleanup
```

### General Workspace Cleanup
```bash
# Complete workspace cleanup (existing)
python cleanup.py

# Launcher shortcuts (existing)
python launcher.py cleanup        # Backup files
python launcher.py cleanup-temp   # Temp directories
```

## Auto-Cleanup Integration
The auto-batch processor now automatically cleans up when `AUTO_CLEANUP=True` in config:
- ✅ Removes temp batch directories
- ✅ Cleans up JSONL files
- ✅ Removes page images
- ✅ Preserves session folders and outputs

## Verification
```bash
# Verify no JSONL files in root
ls *.jsonl  # Should return "No such file"

# Check temp directory structure
ls temp/temp_batch/  # May contain batch info files (OK)

# Test cleanup command
python -m src.batch.batch_api cleanup
```

## Key Benefits
1. **Clean workspace** - No more cluttered root directory
2. **Reliable cleanup** - Files removed even on errors
3. **Existing infrastructure** - No code duplication
4. **Safe operations** - Multiple safety checks prevent accidents
5. **Configurable** - Respects AUTO_CLEANUP setting

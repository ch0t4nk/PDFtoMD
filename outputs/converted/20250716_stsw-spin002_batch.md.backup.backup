## SPINFamily Evaluation Tool

### Data Brief

#### Description

The SPINFamily evaluation tool is Windows-based software whose purpose is to control STSPIN family devices. It requires the Microsoft .NET2 Framework.

It can control the STEVAL-PCC009V2 interface board, EVAL64xxH-DISC or STM32 Nucleo boards. A command section allows controlling the stepper or brush DC motor.

Device configuration can be done through a registry editor, a user-friendly configuration panel, or a wizard. The wizard contains predefined configuration for existing demonstration boards and allows easily configuring the devices.

Configurations can be stored and loaded. A script editor allows controlling each aspect of the device using the Python language.

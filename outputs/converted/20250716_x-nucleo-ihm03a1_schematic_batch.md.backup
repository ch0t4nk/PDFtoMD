## LICENSE
STMicroelectronics ("ST") grants You the right to use the enclosed Evaluation Board offering limited features only to evaluate and test ST products solely for Your evaluation and testing purposes in a research and development setting. The Evaluation Board shall not be, in any case, directly or indirectly assembled as part in any production of Yours as it is solely developed to serve evaluation purposes and has no direct function and is not a finished product. If software and/or firmware is accompanied by a separate end user license agreement ("EULA"), then such software and/or firmware shall be governed by such EULA.

## EVALUATION BOARD STATUS
The Evaluation Board offers limited features allowing You only to evaluate and test the ST products. The Evaluation Board is not intended for consumer or household use. You are not authorized to use the Evaluation Board in any production system, and it may not be offered for sale or lease, or sold, leased or otherwise distributed for commercial purposes. If the Evaluation Board is incorporated in an evaluation system, the evaluation system may be used by You solely for Your evaluation and testing purposes. Such evaluation system may not be offered for sale or lease, sold, or otherwise distributed for commercial purposes and must be accompanied by a conspicuous notice as follows: "This device is not, and may not be, offered for sale or lease, or sold or leased or otherwise distributed for commercial purposes".

## OWNERSHIP AND COPYRIGHT
Title to the Evaluation Board remains with ST and/or its licensors. You may not remove any copyright or other proprietary rights notices without prior authorization from ST.

You shall not use the Evaluation Board in any safety critical or functional safety testing, including but not limited to testing of life supporting, military or nuclear applications. ST expressly disclaims any responsibility for such usage which shall be made at Your sole risk, even if ST has been informed in writing of such usage. Unless expressly designated in writing by ST as suitable for use in testing automotive or aerospace applications, you shall not use the Evaluation Boards in such testing.

According to European Semiconductor Industry Association (ESIA) letter, "ESIA Response on WEEE Review (May 2008) of the Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)"; Semiconductor products and evaluation and demonstration boards are not in the scope of the Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). Consequently aforementioned products do not have to be registered nor are they subject to the subsequent obligations.

## Notice applicable to Evaluation Boards not FCC-Approved
This kit is designed to allow:
1. Product developers to evaluate electronic components, circuitry, or software associated with the kit to determine whether to incorporate such items in a finished product and
2. Software developers to write software applications for use with the product.

This kit is not a finished product and when assembled may not be resold or otherwise marketed unless all required FCC equipment authorizations are first obtained. Operation is subject to the condition that this product not cause harmful interference to licensed radio stations and that it protects against harmful interference. Unless the assembled kit is designed to operate under part 15, part 18 or part 95 of 47 CFR, Chapter I ("FCC Rules"), the operator of the kit must operate under the authority of an FCC license holder or must secure an experimental authorization under part 5 of this chapter.

## For Evaluation Boards annotated as FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) Part 15 Compliant
- **FCC Interference Statement for Class A Evaluation Boards**: This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class A digital device, pursuant to part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference when the equipment is operated in a commercial environment. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instruction manual, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. Operation of this equipment in a residential area is likely to cause harmful interference in which case the user will be required to correct the interference at his own expense.

- **FCC Interference Statement for Class B Evaluation Boards**: This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device, pursuant to part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. There is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If this equipment does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one or more of the following measures:
  - Increase the separation between the equipment and receiver.
  - Connect the equipment to an outlet on a circuit different from that to which the receiver is connected.
  - Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician for help.

- This device complies with part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions: (1) This device may not cause harmful interference, and (2) this device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause
